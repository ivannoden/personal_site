<title>IMA TMT 2024 Conference: Patterns in Prime Numbers | Ivan Noden</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="talks, files, number theory">
<meta name="description" content="The slides for a group presentation on the top Patterns in Prime Numbers
centering around a discussion of Bunyakovsky&rsquo;s Conjecture, in which we touch on
Dirichlet&rsquo;s Theorem, Schinzel&rsquo;s Conjecture, the Twin Prime Conjecture and more.
Last summer, I, Bruno Eaves, and Ioannis Pantelidakis gave a presentation on
Patterns in Prime Numbers, focusing on a discussion around Bunyakovsky&rsquo;s
conjecture which captures many open questions related to prime numbers. This
March, we were very grateful to have the opportunity to give this presentation
at the IMA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Mathematicians Today 2024&rsquo; undergraduate conference.
It was a wonderful event with many great talks so I would very much like to
thank the IMA, the University of Greenwich, Tony Mann, and all others involved
in organising the conference which you can read more about
here. I would also like to
congratulate Andi Hani and Mingjia Yan for winning the prize for best
presentation and the popular vote prize respectively.">
