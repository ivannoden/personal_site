      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the summer of 2024, I was funded by UCL to undertake a research project
under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Cecilia Busuioc. I am very grateful to
UCL for funding this and especially thankful for all the work Cecilia did in
helping me with the project. She was a brilliant supervisor and I am very glad
to have been able to work with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was on elliptic curves with complex multiplication. Below is
attached a set of explanatory notes on the topic and I have pasted the
introduction here for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
