      <title>IMA TMT 2024 Conference: Patterns in Prime Numbers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The slides for a group presentation on the top &lt;strong&gt;Patterns in Prime Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;
centering around a discussion of Bunyakovsky&amp;rsquo;s Conjecture, in which we touch on
Dirichlet&amp;rsquo;s Theorem, Schinzel&amp;rsquo;s Conjecture, the Twin Prime Conjecture and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I, Bruno Eaves, and Ioannis Pantelidakis gave a presentation on
&lt;strong&gt;Patterns in Prime Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing on a discussion around Bunyakovsky&amp;rsquo;s
conjecture which captures many open questions related to prime numbers. This
March, we were very grateful to have the opportunity to give this presentation
at the IMA&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s Mathematicians Today 2024&amp;rsquo; undergraduate conference.
It was a wonderful event with many great talks so I would very much like to
thank the IMA, the University of Greenwich, Tony Mann, and all others involved
in organising the conference which you can read more about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/imatmt2024/home&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I would also like to
congratulate Andi Hani and Mingjia Yan for winning the prize for best
presentation and the popular vote prize respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
