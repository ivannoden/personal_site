Here are my notes for the UCL course **Algebra 4: Groups and Rings** based on
lectures by Yusra Naqvi. All mistakes are my own and all pieces of insight are
hers.

Some parts of the course are glossed over or only brief touched upon within
these notes as they are written assuming the reader has taken a course in
Number Theory.
