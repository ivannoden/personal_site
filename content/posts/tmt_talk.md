The slides for a group presentation on the top **Patterns in Prime Numbers**
centering around a discussion of Bunyakovsky's Conjecture, in which we touch on
Dirichlet's Theorem, Schinzel's Conjecture, the Twin Prime Conjecture and more.

Last summer, I, Bruno Eaves, and Ioannis Pantelidakis gave a presentation on
**Patterns in Prime Numbers**, focusing on a discussion around Bunyakovsky's
conjecture which captures many open questions related to prime numbers. This
March, we were very grateful to have the opportunity to give this presentation
at the IMA's 'Tomorrow's Mathematicians Today 2024' undergraduate conference.
It was a wonderful event with many great talks so I would very much like to
thank the IMA, the University of Greenwich, Tony Mann, and all others involved
in organising the conference which you can read more about
[here](https://sites.google.com/view/imatmt2024/home). I would also like to
congratulate Andi Hani and Mingjia Yan for winning the prize for best
presentation and the popular vote prize respectively.

Below I have attached the slides for the updated version of the talk which was
given at the conference. These changes made the content more approachable and
corrected a few erros in the previous version, as such I have taken those
slides down.
